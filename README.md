InstaStats - Visualize your Instagram statistics like never before
By:Nemanja Aksic

Design Principles:
- Feedback (Spinners while data is loading in d3/c3 visualizations)
- Consistency/Reuse (same colors, same tooltip appearing throughout, same interaction)
- Structure (displaying each visualization as an own "section" on one page)
- Simplicity (no unnecessary information etc, just clean and consistent design
